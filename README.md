Random personal tools, scripts, wrappers, tests, demonstrations, etc.
Usually, what it's in my ~/bin, and it isn't worth to have different
repositories for every one. 

* files that end with a .run are simple wrappers to existing and usually
  has no more than a single line, has no error checks or more elaborated
  scheme
* runnable Perl files have no extension (e.g. don't end up with .pl)
* more elaborated commands (e.g. with a man page) have its own dir
